                    &emsp;<span>P</span>rogramming isn't just a job to me, but something I've been passionate about for a long time; so much so that I made the decision to hit the reset button on my life path and finally pursue this career.  MERN was the stack of choice for a variety of reasons.  React is currently in demand and the rest would allow me to build my hobbiest ideas on all platforms as I pick up more frameworks.

                    &emsp;Admittedly, there's been some bumps in the road and I've spent too much time helping others before myself, but helping people is a large factor in why I chose to learn these skills.  This is only the beginning of my plans and, the sooner I can get into it, the sooner I can develop services and applications that help people.
